	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity, a key concept in computer science, 
		measures how the runtime of an algorithm grows as the input size increases, 
		helping to assess algorithm efficiency and predict performance with larger datasets. efficient</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> is essentially a parallel concept to time complexity. 
		If you need to create an array of size n, this will take O(n) space.</p>
